# asrdb

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Environment Configuration

This project uses `.env` files for runtime configuration. By default, the app
loads `.env`. You can select a different file at run/build time with
`--dart-define`.

Examples:

- Default: `flutter run`
- Prod: `flutter run --dart-define=ENV_FILE=.env.prod`

Make sure the selected file exists in the project root.
